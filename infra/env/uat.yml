# use this file to define environment-specific variables -- you can also override
# global variables here

# this should reference one of the acounts in the global 'account' object:
account: "{{accounts.dev_account}}"

# this bucket already exists and is only needed if you need a place to securely store things,
# like ssh keys -- otherwise, just delete or comment out this variable;
# there is currently one for dev account, one for prod account, and
# one for svc account -- rac-dev-admin, rac-prod-admin, rac-svc-admin, respectively
#-- these are *per-AWS account*, not environment:
admin_bucket: rac-dev-admin

# this bucket is used to store cf templates during deployments, as well
# as other app-env specific artifacts that may be needed for applications
# or their deployment; it is intended that you will create/ensure this bucket
# each time create_stacks.yml is run:
#rac_allowedip_list_id: "041b0e0f-ea2a-428c-b7bb-1a5a28d27c07"
# this variable controls the buckets that are actually created / ensured
# when you run create_stacks.yml:
my_buckets: []
#- "{{infra_bucket}}"
#- "rac-{{ env }}- app

# this variable is only needed if using ansible to provision
# a key pair for ssh access to ec2 instances -- once the keys are
# created, you can access the public / private key by referencing
# ec2_key_pairs.<key_name>.key.name
my_ec2_keys: []

# Example if using ec2 instances -- you could use this variable to define
# per-environment instance types
# ec2_instance_type: t2.medium
